# Video Subtitle Translator

This Python script allows you to generate subtitles for a video file by transcribing its audio content and optionally translating the text into different languages.

## How It Works

1. Input Video: You provide the path to the video file.
2. Audio Extraction: The script extracts the audio from the video.
3. Language Selection: You choose whether to translate the subtitles and select the desired language.
4. Transcription: The audio is transcribed, and subtitles are generated.
5. Translation: If selected, the subtitles are translated into the chosen language.
6. Output: Subtitles are saved in the SubRip (.srt) format.

## Dependencies

- [moviepy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/install.html) : Used for extracting audio from the video.
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) : A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.
- [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) : Provides the transcription model.
- [googletrans](https://py-googletrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) : Utilized for text translation. Note: if it didn't work ``` pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 ```
- [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/) : Displays a progress bar during transcription and translation.

## Note

- Ensure that the necessary models are downloaded and available to the script.
- This script utilizes resources such as CPU and memory, especially during transcription and translation processes, so it's advisable to use it on machines with sufficient resources.
- Depending on the length of the video and the selected translation options, the process may take some time.
